# Usage: known-failures REL
#
# Display the list of tests that fail for REL on a single line.
# This is intended for use as part of the value of ‘XFAIL_TESTS’
# in a "make check" command, for example:
#
#   make check XFAIL_TESTS="$(./known-failures 5.7)" \
#              PATHPREFIX=/usr/bin
#
# In this example, /usr/bin is where RCS 5.7 was installed.
# As a special case, if REL is ‘--list’, display instead
# a list of releases in the internal database.
##

if [ x"$1" = x--help ] ; then
    sed '/^##/,/^##/!d;/^##/d;s/^# //g;s/^#$//g' $0
    exit 0

if [ x"$1" = x--version ] ; then
    echo "known-failures (GNU RCS) @PACKAGE_VERSION@"
    exit 0
fi

if [ x"$1" = x--list ] ; then
    sed '/^\* [0-9.]*$/!d;s/^..//' $0
    exit 0
fi

if [ x"$1" = x ] ; then
    echo "$(basename $0): missing arg (try --help)"

* maintenance instructions (org-mode)
  The rest of the file lists tests known to fail by RCS release.
  Each list should end with a blank line.  Comments begin with
  semicolon and go to end of line.

  Along with the test name, add some commentary explaining why
  that test is known to fail for that release.

  Use "make known-failures" to regenerate it from the .in file.

  The next-up release should have an empty entry during development;
  test failures should be maintained in Makefile.am, like so:
    XFAIL_TESTS += tNNN
  On release, any remaining failures should be moved to the .in file.
  (Obviously, the ideal is to eliminate them prior to release.)

* 5.7
  t150 ; no ‘--version’ / ‘--help’
  t300 ; trailing junk incorrectly ignored
  t311 ; cannot handle [0-9]+ for state, author
  t313 ; rlog omits trailing newline for midline description
  t800 ; outdate everything leaves non-empty RCS file (fixed in 5.8)

* 5.8
  ;; None (yet?).

* end matter
