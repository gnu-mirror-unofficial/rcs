GNU RCS (Revision Control System) manages multiple revisions of
files.  RCS can store, retrieve, log, identify, and merge revisions.
It is useful for files that are revised frequently, e.g. programs,
documentation, graphics, and papers.  It can handle text as well as
binary files, although functionality is reduced for the latter.

A normal installation includes the commands: @b{ci}, @b{co},
@b{ident}, @b{merge}, @b{rcs}, @b{rcsclean}, @b{rcsdiff},
@b{rcsmerge} and @b{rlog} (@pxref{Usage}).  These are small and fast
programs (amenable to scripting) and indeed the distribution also
includes the script @b{rcsfreeze} showing some of the possibilities.

@cindex history
@cindex credits

RCS was designed and built by @WFT{} of Purdue University.  RCS
version 3 was released in 1983.

Adam Hammer, Thomas Narten, and Daniel Trinkle of Purdue supported RCS
through version 4.3, released in 1990.  Guy Harris of Sun contributed
many porting fixes.  Paul Eggert of System Development Corporation
contributed bug fixes and tuneups.  Jay Lepreau contributed 4.3BSD
support.

Paul Eggert of Twin Sun wrote the changes for RCS versions 5.5 and
5.6 (1991).  Rich Braun of Kronos and Andy Glew of Intel contributed
ideas for new options.  Bill Hahn of Stratus contributed ideas for
setuid support.  Ideas for piece tables came from Joe Berkovitz of
Stratus and @WFT{}.  Matt Cross of Stratus contributed test case
ideas.  Adam Hammer of Purdue QAed.

Paul Eggert wrote most of the changes for RCS 5.7.  K.@tie{}Richard
Pixley of Cygnus Support contributed several bug fixes.  Robert
Lupton of Princeton and Daniel Trinkle contributed ideas for
@samp{$Name} expansion.  Brendan Kehoe of Cygnus Support suggested
rlog's @samp{-N} option.  Paul D.@tie{}Smith of Data General
suggested improvements in option and error processing.  Adam Hammer
of Purdue QAed.

Thien-Thi Nguyen is responsibile for RCS 5.8.  He modernized the code
base, build system, and manual pages, fixing some bugs on the way.  He
added standard @samp{--help}, @samp{--version} processing, and wrote
the documentation you are reading (gladly taking inspiration from the
paper@footnote{@TODO Put paper on gnu.org website; add link here.} and
manpages originally written by @WFT{}).

@node Concepts
@section Concepts
@cindex file, working
@cindex working file
@cindex file, RCS
@cindex RCS file

RCS operates on one pair of files at a time.  The @dfn{working file}
is what you normally view and use (e.g., a file of C programming
language source code named @file{a.c}), whereas the @dfn{RCS file} is
the repository for the working file's @dfn{revision} database.  The
RCS file is also called colloquially the ``comma-v file'', due to its
name often ending in @file{,v} (e.g., @file{a.c,v}).

@cindex revision, definition

Each revision in the RCS file is an associated set of information
required to extract a specific instance of the working file.  A
revision includes:

@itemize
@item its @dfn{dot-notation} identifier, that is, a series of
integers separated by dots, such as @samp{1.3.2.4};
@item authorship information (a username);
@item timestamp;
@item an encoding of the changes required to derive the revision's
working file from the revision's @dfn{parent}, i.e., the one
immediately prior to it chronologically;
@item a textual description of the changes, the @dfn{log message};
@item a short user-definable symbol called the @dfn{state}.
@end itemize

@cindex tree of revisions

The RCS file additionally contains information on the links between
parent and child revisions, organized in a tree (strictly acyclic);
an encoded copy of the current working file; and various other metadata.

@node Still missing
@section Still missing
@cindex features, still missing

RCS is still missing some features.  The following is an unordered list
of ``to-do musings'' kept by the RCS maintainers.  We include it here to
give you an idea of RCS's functionality contour.

@itemize

@item Add an option to @b{rcsmerge} so that it can use an arbitrary
program to do the 3-way merge, instead of the default @b{merge}.
Likewise for @b{rcsdiff} and @b{diff}.  It should be possible to pass
arbitrary options to these programs, and to the subsidiary @b{co}
invocations.

@item Add format options for finer control over the output of @b{ident}
and @b{rlog}.  E.g. there should be an easy way for rlog to output lines
like @samp{src/main.c 2.4 wft}, one for each locked revision.  @b{rlog}
options should have three orthogonal types: selecting files, selecting
revisions, and selecting rlog format.

@item Add format options for finer control over the output of keyword
strings.  E.g. there should be some way to prepend @samp{@@(#)}, and
there should be some way to change @samp{$} to some other character to
disable further substitution.  These options should make the resulting
files uneditable, like @samp{-kv}.

@item Add long options, e.g. @samp{--keyword-substitution}.
Unfortunately RCS's option syntax is incompatible with getopt.  Perhaps
the best way is to overload @b{rcs}, e.g., @samp{rcs diff
--keyword-substitution=old file} instead of @samp{rcsdiff -ko file}.

@item @samp{rlog -rM:N} should work even if @var{M} and @var{N} have
different numbers of fields, so long as @var{M} is an ancestor of
@var{N} or vice versa.

@item @b{rcs} should evaluate options in order;
this allows @samp{rcs -oS -nS}.

@item Be able to redo your most recent checkin with minor changes.

@item @samp{co -u} shouldn't complain about a @samp{+w} working file
if contents don't change.

@item Add a @samp{-} option to take the list of pathnames from
standard input.  Perhaps the pathnames should be null-terminated, not
newline-terminated, so that pathnames that contain newlines are handled
properly.

@item Permit multiple option-pathname pairs,
e.g., @samp{co -r1.4 a -r1.5 b}.

@item Add an option to break a symbolic link to an RCS file,
instead of breaking the hard link that it points to.

@item Add ways to specify the earliest revision, the most recent
revision, the earliest or latest revision on a particular branch, and
the parent or child of some other revision.

@item If a user has multiple locks, perhaps @b{ci} should fall
back on the method of @samp{ci -k} to figure out which revision to use.

@item Add an option to @b{rcsclean} to clean directories recursively.

@item Write an @b{rcsck} program that repairs corrupted RCS files,
much as fsck repairs corrupted file systems.  For example, it should
remove stale lock files.

@item Update the date parser to use the more modern @file{getdate.y}
by Bellovin, Salz, and Berets, or the even more modern @code{getdate} by
Moraes.  None of these getdate implementations are as robust as RCS's
old warhorse in avoiding problems like arithmetic overflow, so they'll
have to be fixed first.  (Perhaps we can use gnulib module @code{getdate}.)

@item Break up the code into a library so that it's easier to write
new programs that manipulate RCS files, and so that useless code is
removed from the existing programs.  For example, the @b{rcs} command
contains unnecessary keyword substitution baggage, and the merge command
can be greatly pruned.

@item Make it easier to use your favorite text editor to edit log
messages, etc. instead of having to type them in irretrievably at the
terminal.

@item Let the user specify a search path for default branches,
e.g. to use @var{L} as the default branch if it works, and @var{M}
otherwise.  Let the user require that at least one entry in the default
branch path works.  Let the user say that later entries in the default
branch path are read only, i.e. one cannot check in changes to them.
This should be an option settable by @samp{RCSINIT}.

@item Add a way for a user to see which revisions affected which lines.

@item Have @samp{rlog -nN F} print just the revision number that
@var{N} translates to.  E.g. @samp{rlog -nB. F} would print the highest
revision on the branch B.  Use this to add an option -bB to rcsbranch,
to freeze the named branch.  This should interact well with default
branches.

@item Add a @b{co} option that prints the revision number before
each line, as SCCS's @samp{get -m} does.
[I implemented this for Emacs 22 as a subroutine of @code{vc-annotate}.
This is pretty high priority, so perhaps RCS 5.8 will see it. ---ttn]

@chapter Usage

This chapter describes how to invoke RCS commands, including common
command-line options, as well those specific to each command.

@node Common options
@section Common options

Aside from @samp{--help} and @samp{--version}, RCS commands take the
form @samp{-@var{letter}[@var{arg}]}, that is a hyphen followed by a
single letter, optionally followed by extra information.  The square
braces mean that the extra information is optional.  (No square braces
means that the extra information is required.)  In any case, when
specified, the extra information @strong{must} abut the letter; there
can be no intervening whitespace.

@example
co -u 1.4 foo   # wrong, space between -u and 1.4
co -u1.4  foo   # ok
@end example

@cindex command help
@cindex command version
@noindent
All RCS commands accept @samp{--help} and @samp{--version}.
[In fact, you might notice a striking similarity in the following
sections with the output of each command's @samp{--help}.  Yes, they
are almost identical! ---ttn]

@subsection Revision options

@cindex command-line option to specify a revision
@cindex specifying a revision
@cindex revision, specifying

As to be expected in a revision control system,
many options are of the form @samp{-@var{flag}[@var{rev}]},
where @var{flag} is a single letter (e.g., @samp{r}).
A revision can be specified in many ways:

@table @asis
@item @var{br}.@var{n}
Straightforward dot-notation, where @var{br} specifies the branch.

@item .@var{n}
Like @var{br}.@var{n}, using the default branch.

@item @var{br}
Like @var{br}.@var{n}, using the a command-specific computation
of @var{n}.  For @b{ci}, .e.g, if the current tip is @var{i}, then
the @var{n} would be @code{@var{i}+1} (@pxref{ci}).

@item @var{name}
This is the symbolic name of a revision, as assigned previously by a
@samp{ci -n@var{name}} or @samp{ci -N@var{name}} command.

@item @code{$}
The command computes the effective revision by examining the values of
keyword expansions in the working file.
@end table

@cindex specifying a range of revisions
@cindex revision range, specifying
@cindex range of revisions, specifying
@noindent
For commands that accept a range of revisions, the syntax is
generally @code{@var{rev1}:@var{rev2}}, that is two revisions
(specified as described above) separated by a colon.

@node Date options
@subsection Date options

@cindex specifying a date
@cindex specifying a time/date
@cindex date, specifying
@cindex time/date, specifying
@cindex date formats
@cindex time zone

Some commands accept an option of the form @samp{-d@var{date}} to
specify a @dfn{date}, an absolute point in time (to second resolution),
expressed in a @dfn{date format}.  These also accept @samp{-z@var{zone}}
to specify the timezone.  RCS recognizes many date formats and time
zones.  For example, the following dates are equivalent if local time is
January 11, 1990, 8pm Pacific Standard Time, eight hours west of
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC):

@example
8:00 pm lt
4:00 AM, Jan. 12, 1990           default is UTC
1990-01-12 04:00:00+00           ISO 8601 (UTC)
1990-01-11 20:00:00-08           ISO 8601 (local time)
1990/01/12 04:00:00              traditional RCS format
Thu Jan 11 20:00:00 1990 LT      output of ctime(3) + LT
Thu Jan 11 20:00:00 PST 1990     output of date(1)
Fri Jan 12 04:00:00 GMT 1990
Thu, 11 Jan 1990 20:00:00 -0800  Internet RFC 822
12-January-1990, 04:00 WET
@end example

@noindent
Most fields in the date and time can be defaulted.  The default time
zone is normally UTC, but this can be overridden by the @samp{-z}
option.  The other defaults are determined in the order year, month,
day, hour, minute, and second (most to least significant).  At least one
of these fields must be provided.  For omitted fields that are of higher
significance than the highest provided field, the time zone’s current
values are assumed.  For all other omitted fields, the lowest possible
values are assumed.  For example, without @samp{-z}, the date
@samp{20, 10:30} defaults to @samp{10:30:00 UTC} of the 20th of the UTC
time zone's current month and year.  Note that for the shell, the
date/time must be quoted if it contains spaces.

@node Misc common options
@subsection Misc common options

Other common options are @samp{-q}, @samp{-s}, @samp{-t},
@samp{-T}, @samp{-V}, @samp{-x}.

@table @samp
@item -q
@cindex quiet mode
This option enables @dfn{quiet mode}.
Commands work silently (unless there is an error condition).

@item -s@var{state}
@cindex specifying a state
@cindex state, specifying
Specify the state to be @var{state}.

@item -t@var{text}
@cindex specifying a description
@cindex description, specifying
Specify some text for the RCS file's description.  If @var{text}
begins with a hyphen, it is used directly (dropping the leading hyphen).
Otherwise, it specifies a file name from which the actual text is read.

@item -T
@TODO Write.

@item -V[@var{n}]
@cindex emulation, previous RCS versions
@cindex RCS version emulation
If there is no @var{n}, this behaves like @samp{--version}.
Otherwise, @var{n} specifies the RCS (major) version to emulate.
Valid values for @var{n} are 3, 4, and 5.

@item -x@var{suff}
@cindex specifying a suffix list
@cindex suffix list, specifying
Specify @var{suff} as the slash-separated list of file name suffixes
used to recognize an RCS file.  The default value is @samp{,v/}, that
is, first try with @samp{,v} then try with an empty suffix.

@cindex ci invocation
@cindex invocation, ci

@TODO Convert to texinfo; expand; add links.
@verbatim
Usage: ci [options] file...

Store a new revision of the working file into the RCS file.
FILE... names the working file, or the RCS file, or a series
of alternating WORKING-FILE RCS-FILE pairs.

Options:

  -{fiIjklMqru}[REV]

        Multiple flags in {fiIjklMqru} may be used, except for
        -l, -r, -u, which are mutually exclusive.

        f -- force new entry, even if no content changed
        i -- initial checkin; error if RCS file already exists
        I -- interactive
        j -- just checkin, don't initialize; error if RCS file does not exist
        k -- compute revision from working file keywords
        q -- quiet mode
        r -- normal, if REV is specified; otherwise,
             release lock and delete working file
        l -- like r, but immediately checkout locked (co -l) afterwards
        u -- like l, but checkout unlocked (co -u)
        M -- reset working file mtime (relevant for -l, -u)

        If specified, REV can be symbolic, numeric, or mixed:
          symbolic -- must have been defined previously (see -n, -N)
          $        -- determine the revision number from keyword values
                      in the working file
          .N       -- prepend default branch => DEFBR.N
          BR.N     -- use this, but N must be greater than any existing
                      on BR, or BR must be new
          BR       -- latest revision on branch BR + 1 => BR.(L+1),
                      or BR.1 if new branch
        If REV is omitted, compute it from the last lock (co -l), perhaps
        starting a new branch.  If there is no lock, use DEFBR.(L+1).

  -d[DATE]  -- use DATE (or working file mtime)
  -mMSG     -- use MSG as the log message
  -{nN}NAME -- assign symbolic NAME to the entry; -n signals error if
               NAME already exists; -N overrides any previous assignment
  -sSTATE   -- set state to STATE (default: Exp)
  -tTEXT    -- set description; if TEXT starts with a hyphen (-),
               use it directly, otherwise it names a file to read
               (only valid on initial checkin, ignored afterwards)
  -T        -- set the RCS file’s modification time to the new revision’s
               time if the former precedes the latter and there is a new
               revision; preserve the RCS file’s modification time otherwise
  -V[N]     -- if N is not specified, behave like --version;
               otherwise, N specifies the RCS version to emulate
  -wWHO     -- use WHO as the author
  -xSUFF    -- specify SUFF as a slash-separated list of suffixes
               used to identify RCS file names
  -zZONE    -- specify date output format in keyword-substitution
               and also the default timezone for -dDATE

RCS file, or a series of alternating WORKING-FILE RCS-FILE pairs.

Options:

  -{fIlMpqru}[REV]

        Multiple flags in {fIlMpqru} may be used, except for
        -l, -r, -u, which are mutually exclusive.

        f -- force overwrite of working file
        I -- interactive
        p -- write to stdout instead of the working file
        q -- quiet mode
        r -- normal checkout
        l -- like r, but also lock
        u -- like l, but unlock
        M -- reset working file mtime (relevant for -l, -u)

        If specified, REV can be symbolic, numeric, or mixed:
          symbolic -- must have been defined previously (see ci(1))
          $        -- determine the revision number from keyword values
                      in the working file
          .N       -- prepend default branch => DEFBR.N
          BR.N     -- use this
          BR       -- latest revision on branch BR
        If REV is omitted, take it to be the latest on the default branch.

  -kSUBST

        Generate keyword substitutions depending on SUBST:

        kv  -- (default) default form: $KEYWORD: VALUE $
               with locker name in Header, Id, Locker fields only
               if the RCS file is being locked (via ci -l, co -l)
        kvl -- like kv, but always insert locker name
        k   -- only keyword: $KEYWORD$
        o   -- old value (before checkin): $KEYWORD: OLD-VALUE $
        b   -- like o, except all i/o is done in binary-mode
        v   -- only value: VALUE

  -dDATE  -- select latest before or on DATE
  -jJOINS -- merge using JOINS, a list of REV:REV pairs;
             this option is obsolete -- see rcsmerge(1)
  -sSTATE -- select matching state STATE
  -T      -- preserve the modification time on the RCS file even if the
             RCS file changes because a lock is added or removed
  -wWHO   -- select matching login WHO
  -V[N]   -- if N is not specified, behave like --version;
             otherwise, N specifies the RCS version to emulate
  -xSUFF  -- specify SUFF as a slash-separated list of suffixes
             used to identify RCS file names
  -zZONE  -- specify date output format in keyword-substitution
             and also the default timezone for -dDATE

When the selection options are applied in combination, co
retrieves the latest revision that satisfies all of them.

                  in default branch if REV is omitted
                    r -- specify revision
                    u -- unlock if is locked and no differences found
                    n -- dry run (no act, don't operate)
                    q -- quiet mode

  -kSUBST -- substitute using mode SUBST (see co(1))
  -T      -- preserve the modification time on the RCS file even
             if the RCS file changes because a lock is removed

@TODO Convert to texinfo; expand; add links.
@verbatim
Usage: rcsdiff [options] file ...

Run diff(1) to compare two revisions of each file given.
FILE... names the working file, or the RCS file, or a series
of alternating WORKING-FILE RCS-FILE pairs.

If REV1 and REV2 are specified, compare those revisions.
If only REV1 is specified, compare the working file with it.
If no revisions are specified, compare the working file with
the latest revision on the default branch.

Options:
  -rREV   -- (zero, one, or two times) name a revision
  -kSUBST -- substitute using mode SUBST (see co(1))
  -q      -- quiet mode
  -V[N]   -- if N is not specified, behave like --version;
             otherwise, N specifies the RCS version to emulate

@cindex invocation, rcsmerge

@TODO Convert to texinfo; expand; add links.
@verbatim
Usage: rcsmerge [options] file

Incorporate the changes between two revisions of an RCS file
into the corresponding working file.

One or two revisions must be specified (using -p, -q, or -r).
If only one is specified, use the latest revision on the default
branch to be the second revision.

Options:
  -p[REV] -- write to stdout instead of overwriting the working file
  -q[rev] -- quiet mode
  -rREV   -- (one or two times) specify a revision
  -kSUBST -- substitute using mode SUBST (see co(1))
  -V[N]   -- if N is not specified, behave like --version;
             otherwise, N specifies the RCS version to emulate
  -xSUFF  -- specify SUFF as a slash-separated list of suffixes

@TODO Convert to texinfo; expand; add links.
@verbatim
Usage: rlog [options] file ...

Display information about RCS files.  FILE... names the
working file, or the RCS file, or a series of alternating
WORKING-FILE RCS-FILE pairs.

Options:
  -L        -- ignore RCS files with no locks set
  -R        -- print only the name of the RCS file
  -h        -- print only the "header" information
  -t        -- like h, but also include the description
  -N        -- omit symbolic names
  -b        -- select the default branch
  -dDATES   -- select revisions in the range DATES, with spec:
                 D      -- single revision D or earlier
                 D1<D2  -- between D1 and D2, exclusive
                 D2>D1  -- likewise
                 <D, D> -- before D
                 >D, D< -- after D
               use <= or >= to make ranges inclusive; DATES
               may also be a list of semicolon-spearated specs
  -l[WHO]   -- select revisions locked by WHO (comma-separated list)
               only, or by anyone if WHO is omitted

@cindex bug reporting
@cindex problems
@cindex reporting bugs

To report bugs or suggest enhancements for GNU RCS, please
visit its homepage (@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/})
to find directions on how to ``file a bug report'' online,
or send electronic mail to @email{help-rcs@@gnu.org}.
(If you use the web interface, you don't need to also send email,
since that is done automatically.)

@cindex checklist for bug reports
For bug reports, please include enough information for the maintainers
to reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:

@itemize @bullet
@item The RCS version, command(s) and manual section(s) involved.
@item Hardware and operating system names and versions.
@item The contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug.
@item The expected behavior and/or output.
@item A description of the problem and samples of any erroneous output.
@item Options you gave to @command{configure} other than specifying
      installation directories.
@item Anything else that you think would be helpful.
@end itemize

When in doubt whether something is needed or not, include it.  It's
better to include too much than to leave out something important.

@cindex patches, contributing
Patches are welcome; if possible, please make them with
@samp{git format-patch} and
include @file{ChangeLog} entries (@pxref{Change Log,,, emacs, The GNU
Emacs Manual}).  Please follow the existing coding style.
