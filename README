This directory contains sources and documentation for GNU RCS.

GNU RCS (Revision Control System) manages multiple revisions of files.
RCS can store, retrieve, log, identify, and merge revisions.
It is useful for files that are revised frequently,
e.g. programs, documentation, graphics, and papers.

See the following files and directories for more information.

 AUTHORS - authorship information
 COPYING - copying conditions
 INSTALL - generic installation instructions
 INSTALL.RCS - installation instructions specific to RCS
 NEWS - recent changes
 man/ - sources for manual page entries
 rcs.ms - troff source for the paper `RCS--A System for Version Control'
 rcs_func.ms - brief overview
 src/ - sources for programs

If you lack troff, you can get GNU groff to format the documentation.
