#	Figure out where to put the RCS commands; define RCSDIR accordingly.

RCSDIR = /usr/local/bin


#	Define INSTALL_SETID_FLAGS as needed to install RCS setgid or setuid.
#	This makes sense only when setegid() and seteuid() work
#	Setgid is better than setuid because it mixes with nonstrict locking.
#INSTALL_SETID_FLAGS = ${INSTALL_NORMAL_FLAGS}
#INSTALL_SETID_FLAGS = -g rcs -o root -m 2555
 INSTALL_SETID_FLAGS = ${INSTALL_NORMAL_FLAGS}


#	Define RCSPREFIX to be empty if you want RCS to search the PATH for
#	subsidiary RCS commands like co.  This lets you move RCS commands
#	after building them, and permits multiple instances of setgid RCS
#	commands on the same host for different groups.
#
#	Define RCSPREFIX to a path followed by / if you want RCS to look in
#	just one place.  This makes execution faster.  Also, if your host's
#	execvp() system call does not understand the BSD #!/bin/sh convention
#	for starting shell files, you must use a nonempty RCSPREFIX, because
#	in this case rcsmerge invokes `/bin/sh ${RCSPREFIX}merge'.

#RCSPREFIX =
#RCSPREFIX = ${RCSDIR}/
 RCSPREFIX = ${RCSDIR}/

#	Define DIFF and DIFF3 to be the name of your diff and diff3 programs.
#	DIFF must be an absolute path name if setgid or setuid is used.
#	Define DIFF_FLAGS to be diff's options for RCS format output.
#	If available, use the -a option for comparing arbitrary files.
#	Define DIFF_L to be 1 if your diff understands GNU diff's -L option.
#	Set DIFF3_TYPE=lib for traditional diff, =bin otherwise.
#	If DIFF3_type=bin, make sure your diff3 understands -a, -L, and and -m.
#	If DIFF3_type=lib, avoid the diff3 program visible to users, and
#	use the one in /usr/lib instead; it may be called /usr/lib/diff3prog.

# Traditional diff
#DIFF = /bin/diff
#DIFF_FLAGS = -n
#DIFF_L = 0
#DIFF3 = /usr/lib/diff3
#DIFF3_TYPE = lib

# GNU diff -- must be version 1.15 or later
#DIFFPREFIX = ${RCSDIR}/
#DIFF = ${DIFFPREFIX}diff
#DIFF_FLAGS = -an
#DIFF_L = 1
#DIFF3 = ${DIFF}3
#DIFF3_TYPE = bin

 DIFF = /bin/diff
 DIFF_FLAGS = -n
 DIFF_L = 0
 DIFF3 = /usr/lib/diff3
 DIFF3_TYPE = lib


#	Set SENDMAIL to be a comma-separated list of strings that are a command
#	to send mail.  The first string should be an absolute pathname.
#	The name of the addressee will be appended as a separate argument,
#	and the standard input will be the message (first line "Subject: xxxx",
#	second line empty).

#SENDMAIL = "/bin/mail"
#SENDMAIL = "/etc/delivermail", "-w"
#SENDMAIL = "/usr/lib/sendmail"
 SENDMAIL = "/bin/mail"


#	Decide what loader libraries you need.

#	Decide what C compiler flags you need.

# Optimize.  Put in options that work well for your compiler.

CC_O = -O

# Make all initialized data read-only (not just string literals).

#	If you have version 2 RCS files around, define COMPAT2 to be 1.
#	(Version 2 became obsolete in 1982.)  This assures that version 2
#	RCS files can still be read.  After all version 2 RCS files have
#	been updated with later versions of ci or rcs, you can remake RCS with
#	COMPAT2=0.
COMPAT2 = 0
#	When you have RCS installed, rename old version 2 RCS files as follows
#	(if you have any).  If the working file was "f.c" and the RCS file
#	"f.c.v", rename the RCS file to "f.c,v". If the working file was "f.c"
#	and the RCS file "f.v", rename the RCS file "f.c,v". Thus, suffixes
#	are no longer dropped and RCS files end in ",v" rather than ".v".


#	Now you are ready.  Try to make "conf.h".
#	Check the resulting conf.h for plausibility.
#	If it's wrong, there is a bug in conf.sh; please report it.
#	You can patch conf.h if you're in a hurry, but it's better to fix it;
#	look at a.h and conf.error for ideas.
#	If all else fails, copy conf.heg to conf.h and edit it by hand.

#	Make "all".
#	If all went well, make "install".
#	If installation succeeds, make "installtest";
#	if this fails, make "installdebug" for detailed info.

#	If you want to maintain RCS with itself, be sure you preserve the
#	original revision numbers, dates, etc. by checking the
#	files in with the -k option.

# Avoid brain damage in some versions of 'make'.
